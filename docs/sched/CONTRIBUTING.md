2. **Describe your changes** clearly in your pull request.
3. **Write quality and where possible (minimal-kept) code:**  
   - RAM-only, zero-state logic preferred.
   - Document your code and APIs.
   - Follow the architecture (see [docs/README.md](README.md)).
4. **Test your contribution** on multiple platforms (QEMU, real hardware, etc.).
5. **Open a pull request** with:
   - A clear title and description.
   - Reference to affected files and modules.
   - Any test results or benchmarks.

## Code Standards

- Rust code should be idiomatic, safe, and minimal.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- All new modules and features must be documented.
